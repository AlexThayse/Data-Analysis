# Data Analysis â€“ Dimensionality Reduction and ANOVA

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of multidimensional data through **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**.  
The goal is to reduce the complexity of the data while preserving its structure and variability, and to perform relevant statistical tests on these data.
